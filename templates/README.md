# Message Templates

This directory can contain custom message templates for different scenarios.

## Template Structure

Templates can be organized by:
- Recruiter type (Technical Recruiter, TA Specialist, etc.)
- Message purpose (Initial outreach, Follow-up, etc.)
- Industry or company type

## Usage

The system uses AI generation by default, but you can create custom templates and reference them in the configuration.

## Example Template

```
Hi {recruiter_name},

I noticed your work as a {recruiter_title} at {company_name}. 
I'm a {user_title} with {experience_years} years of experience 
in {skills}.

I'm currently exploring new opportunities and would love to connect. 
Would it be okay if I shared my resume with you?

Thanks for your time!

{user_name}
```
